Text-to-Image Conversion
You enter a prompt (for example: “A futuristic city at sunset in cyberpunk style”).
The model interprets the words and generates an image matching your description.

Diffusion Process
The system starts with random noise (like static on a TV screen).
Step by step, it “denoises” the image, guided by your prompt, until a clear picture emerges.

Latent Space
Instead of directly working with pixels, Stable Diffusion works in a compressed representation (latent space) which makes it efficient and flexible.
